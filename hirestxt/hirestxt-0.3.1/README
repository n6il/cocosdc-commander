To initialize the 51x24 text screen at $0E00, define a HiResTextScreenInit
object and call initHiResTextScreen() with its address:

    #include "hirestxt.h"
    
    ...

    struct HiResTextScreenInit init =
        {
            51,
            writeCharAt_51cols,
            (byte) (0x0E00 / 512),
            TRUE
        };
    initHiResTextScreen(&init);

To use the 42x24 mode, replace 51 and writeCharAt_51cols with 42 and
writeCharAt_42cols.

Then, see hirestxt.h for the available functions.

To link with this library, specify the following on the linking phase
CMOC command line:

    -L <dir> to specify directory where the .a files can be found

    -lhirestxt

    -lhirestxt-51x24 if the 51x24 mode is used by the program

    -lhirestxt-42x24 if the 42x24 mode is used by the program

This system is designed to allow the client program to only include
code and data for one of the two modes, when the program does not
use both modes.


DRAGON SUPPORT

To compile for the Dragon, pass TARGET=dragon to make.
